    "    \"Recent Advances and Emerging Trends in Photo-Electrochemical Solar Energy Conversion. Photo‐electrochemical (PEC) solar energy conversion offers the promise of low‐cost renewable fuel generation from abundant sunlight and water. In this Review, recent developments in photo‐electrochemical water splitting are discussed with respect to this promise. State‐of‐the‐art photo‐electrochemical device performance is put in context with the current understanding of the necessary requirements for cost‐effective solar hydrogen generation (in terms of solar‐to‐hydrogen conversion efficiency and system durability, in particular). Several important studies of photo‐electrochemical hydrogen generation at p‐type photocathodes are highlighted, mostly with protection layers (for enhanced durability), but also a few recent examples where protective layers are not needed. Recent work with the widely studied n‐type BiVO4 photoanode is detailed, which highlights the needs and necessities for the next big photoanode material yet to be discovered. The emerging new research direction of photo‐electrocatalytic upgrading of biomass substrates toward value‐added chemicals is then discussed, before closing with a commentary on how research on PEC materials remains a worthwhile endeavor.\",\n",
    "    \"Ruthenium Water Oxidation Catalysts based on Pentapyridyl Ligands. Ruthenium complexes containing the pentapyridyl ligand 6,6′′-(methoxy(pyridin-2-yl)methylene)di-2,2′-bipyridine (L-OMe) of general formula trans-[RuII(X)(L-OMe-κ-N5)]n+ (X=Cl, n=1, trans-1+; X=H2O, n=2, trans-22+) have been isolated and characterized in solution (by NMR and UV/Vis spectroscopy) and in the solid state by XRD. Both complexes undergo a series of substitution reactions at oxidation state RuII and RuIII when dissolved in aqueous triflic acid–trifluoroethanol solutions as monitored by UV/Vis spectroscopy, and the corresponding rate constants were determined. In particular, aqueous solutions of the RuIII-Cl complex trans-[RuIII(Cl)(L-OMe-κ-N5)]2+ (trans-12+) generates a family of Ru aquo complexes, namely trans-[RuIII(H2O)(L-OMe-κ-N5)]3+ (trans-23+), [RuIII(H2O)2(L-OMe-κ-N4)]3+ (trans-33+), and [RuIII(Cl)(H2O)(L-OMe-κ-N4)]2+ (trans-42+). Although complex trans-42+ is a powerful water oxidation catalyst, complex trans-23+ has only a moderate activity and trans-33+ shows no activity. A parallel study with related complexes containing the methyl-substituted ligand 6,6′′-(1-pyridin-2-yl)ethane-1,1-diyl)di-2,2′-bipyridine (L-Me) was carried out. The behavior of all of these catalysts has been rationalized based on substitution kinetics, oxygen evolution kinetics, electrochemical properties, and density functional theory calculations. The best catalyst, trans-42+, reaches turnover frequencies of 0.71 s−1 using CeIV as a sacrificial oxidant, with oxidative efficiencies above 95 %.\"\n",
