# Experiments with SHAP

* performance comparison between (this is done in: 03-hf-repr/04-scibert-hf-xai):
    * basic SHAP on huggingface models on ZO_UP dataset
    * tf-idf (OSDG, top250 words) SHAP on ZO_UP dataset
* utils for loading both models
* 01-inseq.ipynb try inseq on ft models (SciBERT, LLaMA-3)
